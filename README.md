# fisread
Read a .fis file and calculate the output


Currently supports only 2-input 1-output Mamdani inference

Create a file "input.txt" and place on the first line the number of input pairs you will use, then each input on a different line: 
n
in1
in2
in1
in2
...

The results will be in the "output.txt" file
Make sure all 3 files (fuzzy.fis,input.txt,output.txt) are in the same directory
